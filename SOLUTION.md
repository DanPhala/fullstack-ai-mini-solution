## Joblib vs Pickle: Model Serialization Decision

The project uses **Joblib** for serializing and deserializing machine learning models, instead of the standard Python **pickle** module. This decision was made based on the following trade-offs:

### Why Joblib?
- **Performance**: Joblib is optimized for large NumPy arrays, making it much faster and more memory-efficient for ML models compared to pickle.
- **Compression**: Built-in support for compressed serialization reduces disk usage and speeds up I/O.
- **Reliability**: Joblib handles complex objects (like scikit-learn pipelines) more robustly than pickle.

### Why Not Pickle?
- **Speed**: Pickle can be slow and memory-intensive for large models.
- **Portability**: Pickle files are less portable across Python versions and environments.
- **Security**: Both are unsafe for untrusted sources, but Joblib's focus on ML use cases makes it a better fit here.

## Project Architecture & Design Choices


### SQLAlchemy ORM
- Abstracts database operations, making code more maintainable and testable.
- Trade-off: Slightly more overhead than raw SQL, but much safer and easier to refactor.

### PostgreSQL Database
- Reliable, scalable, and well-supported for analytics workloads.
- Trade-off: Requires containerization for local dev, but Docker Compose solves this.

### Docker & Docker Compose
- Ensures consistent environments for dev, test, and prod.

### Modular Code Structure
- Controllers, services, helpers, and models are separated for clarity and scalability.


### Testing with Pytest
- Chosen for its simplicity and power.
- Trade-off: Requires writing fixtures/mocks for async DB, but results in robust code.

## Summary
This project balances modern Python best practices with practical trade-offs for performance, maintainability, and developer experience. The use of Joblib for ML model serialization is a key decision, optimizing for speed and reliability in a data-driven backend.
